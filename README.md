###Introduction
---

This project creates an image of a [Mandelbrot fractal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set). This repository contains 
four separate codes: a serial version, an OpenMP version, and two hybrid OpenMP and MPI versions.

This project uses the [Distance Estimator](http://mrob.com/pub/muency/distanceestimator.html) method to calculate the Mandelbrot 
set. Each pixel requires its own independent unit of work. Because these units of work are independent, it is a prime candidate 
for parallelizaion. 

The code will perform an iterative calculation at each point that will determine weather the point 
[escapes the set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set#Formal_definition). If the point doesn't escape, then it is 
considered part of the Mandelbrot set and the pixel is painted black.

The Distance Estimator comes into play if the point escapes very slowly (takes many iterations before it escapes). For 
visualization purposes, we consider these points to be part of the set. By doing this, it will "reveal" more of the set than the 
standard method. 

####Serial
This code is located in `serial_mandelbrot.f90`. At the beginning of the serial code, a 2 dimensional grid is allocated in memory. 
This grid will hold either a 1 or 0 in each element to represent whether a point is in the set or not. 

The code then iterates over each point in the grid and performs the Distance Estimator calculation. When the calculation determines 
if the point escapes, it breaks out of the loop and writes a "0" in the grid for that point. Else, it will infer that the point does 
not escape and will write a "1" in the grid. 

After iterating over each point, the grid is then passed to a function that will write out a pgm image to the current working 
directory. The function is code by John Burkardt and can be obtained [here](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/pgma_io/pgma_io.html)

####OpenMP
The OpenMP parallelized version of this code is availible in the file openmp_mandelbrot.f90. The important difference fom the serial version is the following OpenMP pragma statement. As you can see on line 55 it reads
```C
!$OMP PARALLEL DO PRIVATE(ix,iy,cx,cy,iter,i,x,y,x2,y2,temp,xder,yder,dist,xorbit,yorbit,flag) &
!$OMP SHARED(MSet) SCHEDULE(DYNAMIC,chunk)
```
The closing pragma is on line 115 which reads
```C
!$OMP END PARALLEL DO
```

This tells the compiler to separate the enclosed `DO` loop's iterations and run them in parallel on different threads. Private variables and arrays are used when each thread needs to have its own copy. A shared array is used to ensure that all threads update the same array, which is fine since they do so in separate locations.  This simple parallelization is possible because the calculation for each point is independent on any of the surrounding points' calculations. Dynamic scheduling is used because some locations may
take much longer than others to compute.

Again, once the calculations are complete, we rely on  John Burkardt's programs from [here](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/f_src/pgma_io/pgma_io.html), to save the image. 

####MPI Version 1

This version is in the file mpi_1_mandelbrot.f90. It uses a static decomposition of the domain. This ignores the fact that 
portions near the boundary of the Mandelbrot set may take a very long time to compute compared to other portions of the domain.

####MPI Version 2

This uses a queue to ensure load balancing. The approach is documented in Balras [Multicore and GPU programming: An integrated approach](http://store.elsevier.com/Multicore-and-GPU-Programming/Gerassimos-Barlas/isbn-9780124171374/) with code [here](booksite.elsevier.com/9780124171374/download/mcore_code_v1.03.zip), as well as in Gropp, Lusk and Skelljum [Using MPI](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/using-mpi) with code [here](ftp.mcs.anl.gov/pub/mpi/usingmpi-1st/examples.tar.gz)

####Compiling
To compile the codes use your fortran compiler, for example gfortran or OpenMPI/mpich/mvapich and gfortran

  gfortran serial_mandelbrot.f90 -o serial_mandelbrot

  gfortran -fopenmp openmp_mandelbrot.f90 -o openmp_mandelbrot

  mpif90 -fopenmp mpi_1_mandelbrot.f90 -o mpi_1_mandelbrot

  mpif90 -fopenmp mpi_2_mandelbrot.f90 -o mpi_2_mandelbrot

The code can then be run

  ./serial_mandelbrot
  
  ./openmp_mandelbrot
 
  mpirun mpi_1_mandelbrot

  mpirun mpi_2_mandelbrot

and once it completes should put a picture file in the running directory. The picture can be opened in many viewers, such as 
[GIMP](https://www.gimp.org/) or [Gwenview](https://userbase.kde.org/Gwenview)
